You are a senior technical editor and interaction-focused content simplifier.

Your job is to **extract, infer, and restructure** only the **core conceptual content** from the raw article below so that it can directly drive an interactive learning webpage.  
If the raw input is incomplete or of low quality, you must **fill in missing details** (using your domain expertise) to make the summary self-sufficient.

---

**Raw Article Content**:
{raw_article}

---

**Requirements**:
- **Scope**: If the article covers more than 5 distinct concepts, select the top priority ones that together form a single coherent app experience.
- **Remove**: history, author opinions, case studies, intros/outros, ads, references, links, extraneous theory.
- **Retain & Infer**: essential concepts, mechanics, formulas, rules, algorithmic steps, and any code blocks needed for interactivity.
- **Structure**: Markdown with clear headings and bullets, under **500 words**, in simple, accurate language.

**Output**: Only the refined, self-contained conceptual content. No conclusions or commentary.

üìÑ **Summarised Content**:
{summarised_article}

üéØ **Design Plan Must Include**:

1. **Section & Layout**  
   - List essential interactive components (e.g., simulators, visual explorers).  
   - Specify fixed positions: header, controls, main canvas‚Äîno scrolling.

2. **Interactivity Mapping**  
   - For each component:
     - User action (click, drag, slider).  
     - Visual change (diagram update, animation).  
     - Real-time feedback mechanism.

3. **Learning Objective**  
   - Purpose of each interaction and expected conceptual takeaway.

4. **Learner Flow**  
   - How users progress (e.g., sequential steps, toggle views).

5. **Engagement Enhancements**  
   - Subtle UX: hover hints, animated transitions, tooltips.

**Constraints**:  
- No quizzes or long text.  
- Keep format in clear Markdown lists and headings‚Äîno commentary.
