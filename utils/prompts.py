   - Fixed layout using `vh`/`vw`.  
   - Central **canvas or interaction panel** preferred.  
   - Header and footer clearly visible.

3. **Controls & Interactivity**  
   - Use interactivity **only if needed to teach the concept**.

4. **Visual Theme**

5. **Footer Content**  
   - Fixed at the bottom.  
   - Includes links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

**Non-Negotiables**:  
- No scrolling.  
- No unnecessary UI.
