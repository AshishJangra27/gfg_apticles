| Tree Construction                | Understand the fundamental structure of a binary tree and how nodes are connected.                             | Learners can build arbitrary binary trees and visualize their structure.                                                                                                                       |
| Traversal                        | Learn and visualize different tree traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).                                             | Learners can identify the order in which nodes are visited for each traversal method.                                                                                                      |
| Insertion                        | Understand the process of inserting a new node into a binary tree using level order traversal.                  | Learners can visualize how a new node is placed in a binary tree to maintain its structure.                                                                                                    |
| Deletion                         | Understand the process of deleting a node from a binary tree and maintaining its structure.                     | Learners can visualize the node replacement and deletion process.                                                                                                                             |
| Tree Properties                  | Understand how tree properties (height, number of nodes) relate to the tree's structure.                       | Learners can observe how changes to the tree structure affect its properties.                                                                                                              |
| Tree Types      | Understand the visual aspects that make each type of tree special.                     | Learners can look at the visual example graph of a full, skewed, perfect, etc. tree.                                                                                                                             |

### üß™ Cognitive Flow & Learner Progression

1.  **Start with Tree Construction (Left Panel):** Learners build a binary tree. This anchors their understanding of tree structure.
2.  **Explore Traversal (Right Panel):** Select a traversal method and visualize its execution on the constructed tree.
3.  **Experiment with Insertion and Deletion (Right Panel):** Add or remove nodes and observe the changes.
4.  **Observe Properties (Right Panel):** See how the tree properties change dynamically as the tree is modified.
5.  **Tree Types (Right Panel):** select an example of a tree type, and visualize what makes the tree special.

Learner progression is driven by interaction. No explicit navigation is required.  The left panel acts as the input, and the right panel as the dynamic output/visualization area.

### ‚ú® Subtle Engagement Elements

*   **Hover Hints:** Hovering over nodes in the traversal visualization could display the order number in which the node is visited.
*   **Animated Transitions:** Smooth transitions when nodes are added, deleted, or highlighted during traversal to improve visual clarity.
*   **Guided Tooltips:**  A tooltip that initially highlights the interactive elements in each panel on first load. "Build Your Tree", "Choose Traversal". Dismissed automatically after a brief period or on user interaction.
*   **Colour Coding:** Colour code nodes based on their depth or level.
