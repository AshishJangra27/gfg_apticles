## üß† Learning Objective Behind Each Interaction

| Interaction             | Learning Objective                                                                                                   | Expected Outcome                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vector Input            | Understand how vector components affect the direction and magnitude of a vector.                                   | Learner can predict the visual representation of a vector based on its components.                                               |
| Cosine Similarity       | Learn how changes in vector direction influence cosine similarity.                                                 | Learner understands that vectors pointing in similar directions have higher cosine similarity.                                       |
| Angle vs. Similarity    | Directly relate the angle between vectors to the cosine similarity score.                                         | Learner internalizes the concept that cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between vectors.                                  |
| Magnitude Ignorance | Demonstrate how magnitude can misguide a similarity measurement if looking only at magnitude                         | Learner recognizes when the direction matters more than the magnitude.                                                         |
| Sparse Data Simulation  | Understand the sensitivity of cosine similarity to sparse data.                                                     | Learner recognizes that cosine similarity might be misleading when vectors have many zero components.                                |
| Orientation Focus       | Grasp that cosine similarity is inherently an orientation-based metric.                                              | Learner appreciates that cosine similarity emphasizes the relative orientation of vectors, not the absolute magnitudes.              |

## üß™ Cognitive Flow & Learner Progression

1.  **Initial State:** Display two default vectors in the scatter plot. Show the cosine similarity formula with initial values.
2.  **Vector Exploration:** User modifies vector components via numerical input fields.
3.  **Visual Feedback:** Scatter plot updates in real-time, showing changes in vector direction and angle. The formula values update.
4.  **Angle-Similarity Correlation:** User observes the direct relationship between the angle in the scatter plot and the cosine similarity score.
5.  **Sparse Data:** User toggles sparse data simulation to see the impact on the similarity.
6.  **Orientation vs Magnitude:** User toggles orientation focus to see impact

## ‚ú® Subtle Engagement Elements

*   **Hover Hints:** Hovering over vector lines in the scatter plot highlights the corresponding input fields.
*   **Animated Transitions:** Smooth transitions when vectors change, making the visual feedback more engaging.
*   **Tooltip on Magnitude change** Showing the magnitude value on vector length effect change, also, how the similarity changes if solely magnitude were considered.
